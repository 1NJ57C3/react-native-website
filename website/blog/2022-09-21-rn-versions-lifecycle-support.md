# React Native Version and Lifecycle support

We wanted to share with you the first version of the React Native Version support document.

## Purpose

> As we look for ways to better support the React Native community, we will move towards supporting a limited number of versions of React Native better.

The React Native Core team is working to strike a balance between the speed of innovation with the amount of regular change to the platform. We understand that each release brings new value and has an adoption cost to the community. This document describes how we intend to formally balance these concerns and provide clear and consistent support over time. React Native team will work on best-effort basis to release a new version of React Native at least every four months. And will focus on speeding up the release cycle and put considerable effort into ensuring a seamless upgrade path. This document describes the level of support we can provide and which set of versions is supported.

## Where can I find the document

For versioning and ease of maintenance purposes React Native Version and Lifecycle support document will be kept in the readme file within the React Native Releases GitHub repository link: [React Native Version and Lifecycle support document](https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-releases#react-native-version-and-lifecycle-support)
